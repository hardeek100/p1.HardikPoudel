    <h2>Microwave User Interface </h2>

    <div id = "container">
        <p id = "text1">Microwaves oven are the kitchen appliances used to heat food. It has been around us most of our lives.
            Thousands of companies sell microwaves with different designs but most of the microwaves that we see either have too many 
            buttons or unnecessary buttons and we may never use some of them. The user interface has to be clear and functional.
            

        </p>
        <div id = "olddesign">
            <img src="medias/badinterface.jpeg" style="width:400px;height:400px;" />
            <img src = "medias/olddesign.gif" />
        </div>
        
    
        <p id = "text1">
            Take this microwave from my workplace for an example. The buttons on the user panel are confusing and
            unnecessary. I might never use some of the buttons.
            The door switch is not labeled and has no power switch. Eldery people will have trouble figuring out the buttons
            on this microwave. If there are childrens in the house they can push random buttons on the microwave and it can be running for hours and can waste energy.
            Because the door only opens from from right to left,
            left handed people
            will have to spend some time getting used to it. 
        </p>
        
        <p id="text1">
            I mostly use microwave to reheat the leftover foods, cook popcorn or rarely to defrost the food and cook
            pizza.
            The interface from the example microwave has only popcorn button and quick 30s buttons that are helpful. The other
            buttons
            are unnecessary or confusing and I might never press it. 
        

        The common sequence of user interaction with the microwave are:

        </p>
    <div id = "text1">
       <li>1. Turn Power On</li>
        <li>2. Open Door  </li>
        <li>3. Place food</li>
        <li>4. Close Door</li>
        <li>5. Select a timer or food option</li>
        <li>6. Start</li>
        <li>7. Wait for timer to complete</li>
        <li>8. Open Door</li>
        <li>9. Take food</li>
        <li>10. Close door</li>
        <li>11. Turn Power Off</li>
    </div>
        <p id="text1">
            The microwave contains display panel for feedback for users, extra buttons, number keypad and control buttons. User can interact with
            the device by pressing the buttons of their choice and get the feedback from the display. The light in the food compartment lets the user
            know if the device is running or not. 
        </p>
        <p id = "text1">
            With the current design people might make a common mistake by pressing wrong buttons, search for power button and 
            door switch. 

        </p>

        <h1>Improvements</h1>
        <div id = "text1">

        
        <p>
            There are some improvements that can be made for the control interface. 
           
            <li>Use food icons for the extra buttons</li>
            <li>Insert power button</li>
            <li>Insert door switch </li>
            <li>Open door upwards so that its helpful for both right or left handed users</li>
            The Low-Fidelity Prototype sketch is shown below.
        </p>
        
    </div>
        
        <div id ="currentdesign">
            <img src = "medias/sketch.png" style="width:500px;height:320px;">
           
            <img src="medias/p1.HardikPoudel.gif" style="width:1000px;height:500px;"/>
            
        </div>

        <p id = "text1"> This is a microwave design I came up with. The screen size is 1000*500. It contains all the 
            buttons for options that microwave is mostly used for. I have used icons to represent the extra buttons
             instead of text label so that user can easily identify them. Instead of unnecessary and confusing buttons 
             i have only included the most used buttons of the microwave. The user can set the timer using the number 
             keypad, and control the microwave from the control panel. The power button will stop childrens from pressing random 
             buttons. The door opens upward so, it will work for both right or left handed users.
