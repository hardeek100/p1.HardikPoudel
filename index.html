    <h2>Microwave User Interface </h2>

        <p id = "text1">Microwaves oven are the kitchen appliances used to heat food. It has been around us most of our lives.
            The way we interact are with the buttons on the device. Thousands of companies sell microwaves with
            different designs.
            Some microwaves have too many buttons and some do not even have the required ones.

            Take this microwave from my workplace for an example. The buttons on the user panel are confusing and
            unnecessary.
            The door switch is not labeled and has no power switch. Because the door only opens from from right to left,
            left handed people
            will have to spend some time getting used to it.
        </p>
        </div>
        <p id="text1">
            I mostly use microwave to reheat the leftover foods, cooking popcorn or rarely to defrost the food and cook
            pizza.
            The interface from the example microwave has only popcorn and quick 30s buttons that are helpful. The other
            buttons
            are unnecessary and I might never press it.
        

        The common sequence of user interaction with the microwave are:

        </p>
        <div id = "text1">
        <li> 1. Turn power on</li>
        <li> 2. select the food or set timer</li>
        <li> 3. open door</li>
        <li> 4. place food</li>
        <li> 5. close door</li>
        <li> 6. start</li>
        <li> 7. wait for food</li>
        <li> 8. open door</li>
        <li> 9. take food</li>
        <li> 10. close door</li>
        <li> 11. turn power off</li>
    </div>
        <p id="text1">
            The microwave provides a user feedback on the display panel. The user panel has the icons for the desired
            food and number pad to
            set the desired time. The door switches between open and close when pressed. The current design also has the
            power button so that
            when the microwave is in the off state user input will be disregarded and will save power.
        </p>
